Title: Regularized Copula-Based Mixture Model: Estimation and Model Selection
Version: 0.1.0

Maintainer: Ben Barlow <ben.j.barlow.1@gmail.com>
Description: Model-based clustering through regularized copula-based mixture models with arbitrary marginal distributions. Estimation via the expectation-conditional-maximization algorithm. Shrinkage driven methods used to adaptively select optimal correlation structure regulated by a tuning parameter. Model selection based on average silhouette width and BIC.
